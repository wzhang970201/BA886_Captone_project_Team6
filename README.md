<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Credit information is one the most important features to predict the future losses for home insurance companies. Home owner policies with no returned credit information from credit bureaus are credit NoHit policies. These policies tends to have higher claim losses historically. The goal of this project is to build predictive model to predict which properties tends to be NoHit from credit bureaus using multiple data sources, thus to help price these properties accurately in our pricing models.

#### Objectives
The objective s for this project are 2 folds:
1.	Achieve good segmentations and accuracy comparing on various validation data sets to predict credit NoHit.  The main measures of the prediction GINI coefficients and AUC (area under the curve).
2.	Compare several modeling techniques to see if we can achieve better results through investigating more modeling methods 


### Built With

We will use python to build all prediction model and visualization for project analysis. 
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
